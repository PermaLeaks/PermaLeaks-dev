Discussion of PermaLeaks Protocols improvement proposals (PIPs)

Permaleaks is a open source platform for whistleblowsers, joursalists, hackers and more anti-censorship / corruption persons to leaks the data/information in their hands in a way which assure their anonymoty, and let them monetize their documents for more than 200 years using <a href="https://arweave.org">Arweave's</a> Permaweb.

Beside that, Permaleaks will periodically archive well chosen content: wikileaks, Julian Assange, Snowden and more "historic stations" that exposed the "behind the scenes".

Permaleaks will also work on series of Privacy protocols built on Arweave: <a href="https://github.com/PermaLeaks/torweave">torweave</a>, xmail, AR bl3nd3r.

* torweave : aka Arweave Over Tor, interact with Arweave HTTP api anonymously. Used for Permaleaks platform
* xmail : forked version of Weavemail protocol. Untraceable sender
* AR bl3nd3r : is a centralised service to mix/blend AR coins
